# Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Thales Emanoel, passionate about technology and software development. My journey with computing began at the age of eight when I had access to my first command via cmd to schedule a computer shutdown at a specific time, and since then, there was no turning back. </br>

Currently, I am pursuing Information Systems at PUC Minas, focusing on learning more and more to refine my professional skills to the fullest.

# Expertise ðŸš€

I have a strong ability and inclination towards backend development, creating APIs, solving mathematical problems, and personal organization projects. I have a good understanding of Java, C#, Python, and Node.js. While I am still improving, I also handle frontend development using HTML and CSS.
